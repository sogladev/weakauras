mage_portal_tp_panel_sod_era.txt

## Mage - Portal Teleport Panel Backport WA 4.0.0
portal335_learned_tbc.txt  portal335_learned_vanilla.txt  portal335_learned_wotlk.txt

Shows a clickable menu for 10 seconds with a macro. You must be out of combat to cast teleport/portals so the menu will not show when in combat.

/run WeakAuras.ScanEvents(
"PORTAL_MACRO");

note: Regarding "Warnings". WA will show "Secure frame" warning which is normal as this is not an intended way to use WeakAuras. Since this WA is only used out of combat, there shouldn't be an issue

## ALL FERALS ARE RATS
feral_form_portrait_changer.txt
Changes the druid portrait icon from a cat to a giant rat.

Known problem(s):

    very likely does not work with elvUI or any other custom unit frames. Only blizzard frames
    Target of target sometimes doesn't change to rat when shapeshifting

Implementation is based on ClassPortraitsFinal by PvPArthur which uses the same technique to show Class Icons on portraits. In this WA I show a rat portrait when a player druid is in cat form

ulduar_hodir_flash_freeze.txt
